We aim to keep Rocket's code quality at the highest level. This means that any
code you contribute must be:

  * **Commented:** Public items _must_ be commented.
  * **Documented:** Exposed items _must_ have rustdoc comments with
    examples, if applicable.
  * **Styled:** Your code should be `rustfmt`'d when possible.
  * **Simple:** Your code should accomplish its task as simply and
     idiomatically as possible.
  * **Tested:** You should add (and pass) convincing tests for any functionality you add when it is possible.
  * **Focused:** Your code should do what it's supposed to do and nothing more.

Note that unless you
explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in oxigen by you shall be dual licensed under the MIT License and
