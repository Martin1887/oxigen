# oxigen

oxigen is a parallel genetic algorithm library implemented in Rust. The name comes from the merge of `OXI`daci√≥n (Rust translated to Spanish) and `GEN`etic.

oxigen provides the following features:

* Fast and parallel genetic algorithm implementation (it solves the N Queens problem for N=255 in few seconds). For benchmarks view benchmarks section of this file.
* Customizable mutation and selection rates with constant, linear and cuadratic functions according to generations built-in (you can implement your own functions via the `MutationRate` and `SelectionRate` traits).
* Customizable age unfitness of individuals, with no unfitness, linear and cuadratic unfitness with threshold according to generations of the individual built-in (you can implement your own age functions via the `Age` trait).
* Accumulated `Roulette`, `Tournaments` and `Cup` built-in selection functions (you can implement your own selection functions via the `Selection` trait).
* `SingleCrossPoint` built-in crossover function (you can implement your own crossover function via the `Crossover` trait).
* `Worst` built-in survival pressure function (the worst individuals are killed until reaching the original population size). You can implement your own survival pressure functions via the `SurvivalPressure` trait.
* `SolutionFound`, `Generation` and `Progress` built-in stop criteria (you can implement your own stop criteria via the `StopCriterion` trait).
* `Genotype` trait to define the genotype of your genetic algorithm. Whatever struct can implement the `Genotype` trait under the following restrictions:
    - It has a `iter` function that returns a `use std::slice::Iter` over its genes.
    - It has a 'into_iter' function that consumes the individual and returns a ' use std::vec::IntoIter' over its genes.
    - It implements `FromIterator` over its genes type, `Display`, `Clone`, `Send` and `Sync`.
    - It has functions to `generate` a random individual, to `mutate` an individual, to get the `fitness` of an individual and to know if and individual `is_solution` of the problem.
* Individual's fitness is cached to not do unnecessary recomputations (this can be disabled with `.cache_fitness(false)` if your fitness function is stochastic and so you need to recompute fitness in each generation).
* Progress statistics can be configured to be printed every certain number of generations to a file.
* Population individuals with their fitnesses can be configured to be printed every certain number of generations to a file.


## Usage

To use `oxigen` `use oxigen::prelude::*` and call the `run` method over a `GeneticExecution` instance overwriting the default hyperparameters and functions folllowing your needs:

```
let n_queens: u8 = std::env::args()
    .nth(1)
    .expect("Enter a number between 4 and 255 as argument")
    .parse()
    .expect("Enter a number between 4 and 255 as argument");
let progress_log = File::create("progress.csv").expect("Error creating progress log file");
let population_log =
    File::create("population.txt").expect("Error creating population log file");
let log2 = (f64::from(n_queens) * 4_f64).log2().ceil();
let population_size = 2_i32.pow(log2 as u32) as usize;
let (solutions, generation, progress) = GeneticExecution::<u8, QueensBoard>::new()
    .population_size(population_size)
    .genotype_size(n_queens as u8)
    .mutation_rate(Box::new(MutationRates::Linear(SlopeParams {
        start: f64::from(n_queens) / (8_f64 + 2_f64 * log2) / 100_f64,
        bound: 0.005,
        coefficient: -0.0002,
    })))
    .selection_rate(Box::new(SelectionRates::Linear(SlopeParams {
        start: log2 - 2_f64,
        bound: log2 / 1.5,
        coefficient: -0.0005,
    })))
    .select_function(Box::new(SelectionFunctions::Cup))
    .age_function(Box::new(AgeFunctions::Cuadratic(
        AgeThreshold(50),
        AgeSlope(1_f64),
    )))
    .progress_log(20, progress_log)
    .population_log(2000, population_log)
    .run();
```

## Building

To build oxigen, use `cargo` like for any Rust project:

* `cargo build` to build in debug mode.
* `cargo build --release` to build with optimizations.

To run benchmarks, you will need a nightly Rust compiler. Uncomment the lines `// #![feature(test)]` and `// mod tests;` from `lib.rs` and then bechmarks can be run using `cargo bench`.


## Benchmarks

The following benchmarks have been created to measure the genetic algorithm functions performance:

```

The difference of performance among the different fitness benchmarks have the following explanations:

 * `bench_fitness` measures the performance of a cached execution cleaning the fitnesses after each bench iteration. This cleaning is the reason of being a bit slower than not cached benchmarks.
 * `bench_fitness_age` measures the performance with fitness cached in all bench iterations, so it is very much faster.
 * Not cached benchmarks measure the performance of not cached executions, with 1 generation individuals in the last case, so the performance is similar but a bit slower for the benchmark that must apply age unfitness.


 The `bench_tournaments` is slower than cup and roulette because it has been configured with `population_size / 2` tournaments of the same size of individuals. In practice, a configuration like this is only used in the last generations of the algorithm where the selection rate is high, being very much faster in the previous generations.
